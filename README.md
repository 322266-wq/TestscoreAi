# Test Score Prediction AI

## Problem
Students often wonder how studying and sleep affect test performance.
The goal of this project is to predict a student's test score based on
how many hours they studied and how much sleep they got.

## Solution
I created a machine learning model that learns from past student data.
The model looks at study hours and sleep hours and predicts a test score
using linear regression.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Google Sheets
- GitHub

## Results
The AI successfully predicted a test score for a student who studied
6 hours and slept 8 hours.

Example output:
"The AI predicted a test score of 85.4 for a student who studied 6 hours
and slept 8 hours."

## Learning
I learned how machine learning models are trained using real data and
how Python can be used to build and publish AI projects.
